# HwkEngine
Java Game Engine using LWJGL 2.9.1
I decided to use an earlier version of LWJGL because that's
the version the tutorial was using, and I didn't want to deal
with the hassle of keeping up.

Made using [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP) from ThinMatrix

## Reason to make
To help me learn OpenGL
